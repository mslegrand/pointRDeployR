# ptR
This is an electron-based wrapper around the shiny pointR package. This wrapper provides

1 a standardize graphical interface (removin the depencency upon the users browser)
2 enhancement of pointR by providing a mechanism to debug custom build shiny input controls within pointR. 
3 A mostly seamless installation for both linux and mac


when building, be sure to set icon permissions to 0644 (sudo chmod 0644)
